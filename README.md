# guessing-game
<P>The game is played by Dealer and Player. Dealer generates a random integer number between 0 and 10. Player has to guess it. The program should take input from Player as long as Player inputs same number as Dealer’s input was. Player gets advice to choose greater or smaller numbers in next choice.
